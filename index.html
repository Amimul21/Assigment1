In the mood for a battle royale of epic proportions? PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has got you covered. Into sports? In a merging of the two worlds, the NBA and Take-Two Interactive—publisher of the super-popular NBA 2K video game series—partnered to create the NBA 2K eLeague. In the esports world, there's a video game, and related scene, for everyone.

        Maybe there too much choice. There are so many video games on the market with a competitive, multiplayer focus that getting started in playing, or simply watching, professional video gaming may prove intimidating. Fortunately, this guide to the best esports games will nudge you in the right direction. After all, every game going after that sweet esports money isn't worth your time. And there are a whole lot of those.</p>
